# ranchreports
building markdown files where a full ranch report can be published easily

## steps 
1. Download python (I have the code written for conda environment but you can do it with pip too. See here for more details: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023654474-Installing-and-Configuring-Python-with-RStudio

2. run the scripts in the top of the .rmd file in terminal
3. get the required .json earth engine API key file from me and place it into the same folder as your working directory
4. find the shapefile directory in the .rmd file and add the relevant file path
5. Run each code section and gather what you need seperately or knit the whole document at once
